In content distribution and 5G wireless networks, in-network caching has become an important solution for efficient data transmission in  using network resources. Based on the acquisition of transport protocol features (e.g., TCP/IP, ICN, etc.), this project obtains cache metrics and proposes distributed content placement strategies for supporting network cache architecture.



# Key points
* Content placement: A Bayesian ranking model is used to cache content with the aggregation caching features;
* Caching node selection: A network partitioning scheme for select the caching node to achieve low latency;
* The proposed approach can reduce 56% content access latency.
