In this project, we developed a lightweight virtual cluster management system, named as Humilis, for enabling adaptable resource management in practice. For easy transformation from cloud to edge with the network, Humilis decouples the control module, compute model and storage module in order to fit the uncertain requirements of edge computing. This design offers a flexibility in allocating the virtual instances disk files in a shared disk manner or non-shared disk manner. In this architecture, a mobile user exploits virtual machine (VM) technology to rapidly instantiate customized service software on a nearby cloudlet, and then uses that service over a wireless connection.
